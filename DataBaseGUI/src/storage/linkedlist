Linked List Data Structure:

A linked list is another fundamental data structure, distinct from a stack. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can dynamically adjust to accommodate elements.

Node Structure:

A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
Simple and easy to implement.
Doubly Linked List:

Each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes.
Allows for easy traversal in both directions.
Circular Linked List:

Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.
Basic Operations on Linked Lists:

Insertion:

Adding a new node to the list.
Insertion can occur at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Deletion:

Removing a node from the list.
Deletion can occur at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Traversal:

Visiting each node in the list sequentially.
Search:

Finding a specific node in the list based on its data.
Advantages of Linked Lists:

Dynamic Size:

Linked lists can dynamically adjust in size, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion:

Insertion and deletion operations are more efficient compared to arrays.
No Wasted Memory:

Memory is allocated as needed, avoiding the issue of wasted memory in arrays.
Versatility:

Different types of linked lists cater to specific needs.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists:

Random Access:

Linked lists don't allow for direct access to elements; traversal is necessary.
Memory Overhead:

Each node requires additional memory for the reference to the next node.
Complexity:

Implementing and understanding linked lists might be more complex than arrays for some.
Common Use Cases for Linked Lists:

Dynamic Memory Allocation:

Linked lists are suitable for scenarios where dynamic memory allocation is crucial.
Implementing Data Structures:

Linked lists are building blocks for more complex data structures like queues and stacks.
Memory Management:

In scenarios where memory needs to be allocated and deallocated efficiently.
Undo Mechanism:

Linked lists can be used to implement undo and redo functionality in applications.
Music Playlists:

Playlists in music applications often use linked lists for dynamic ordering of songs.
Task Management:

Managing tasks and their dependencies in project management tools.
Graphs and Trees:

Linked structures are foundational in representing graphs and trees.
Remember, understanding both stacks and linked lists is essential as they serve different purposes and can be combined to solve various computational problems.
